# Hi there

I'm Alireza Javadi, a back-end programmer with a passion for building solutions that make a difference. From crafting efficient websites to solving complex bugs, I love tackling the challenges that come my way.

Beyond back-end development, I’m fascinated by robotics and often dive into 3D game development with Unity—just for fun! I have two years of experience in the programming world, and every day I'm eager to learn and innovate even more.

Type cd ~/projects then ls to explore some of the robots, websites, and projects I've created in my coding journey so far.
